            <p style="color:#999">If Singularity can be "one container to rule them all," the effort of Singularity Registry is to empower researchers, academics, developers, and all users alike to share their containers.</p>
            <p style="color:#999">To get started, you should <a href="https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry" target="_blank">read about</a> how to set up your registry. If you want it to appear here for others to find your containers, simple add a page to the repo in the <strong>_registries</strong> folder. That's it! You can also have a registry for private use.</p>
            <p style="color:#999">Singularity Registry is a sibling of <a href="https://www.singularity-hub.org" target="_blank">Singularity Hub</a> and a proud part of the open source <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity </a> containers project. Thanks for visiting!</p>
